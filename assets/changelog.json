  "motd": "Welcome to LunaSea v6.0.0!\n\nSonarr has had many foundational changes and now only supports v3.0.0+ of Sonarr as LunaSea now only utilizes the v3 API routes to make the module much more performant. The episode view has been revamped to now include file media information and single episode history, and you can now view all, series-specific, or season-specific history with the new history tiles that contain much more information!\n\nMany additional changes (and reintroducing removed features such as the queue and multi-episode select) will come soon in additional builds of v6.0.0 in the coming weeks!",
