## Edge

This channel's purpose is to _ensure that every commit made to master is building across all platforms_ and allows for easier access to a build for each commit. This is not intended to be used by the average user, but is for community developers or users who need to test a recently added fix that has not yet reached the beta channel.

There are no restrictions on features in these builds (barring a very specific subset used for debugging/testing) so it gives full access to everything that is work in progress.

**Do not expect a fully stable experience if you use these builds**, as it is entirely possible that a single build could cause problems including but not limited to database corruption. If you are running these builds, please ensure you have either a cloud or offline backup available for easy restoration.

Edge releases can be downloaded from the [build bucket](https://builds.lunasea.app/#/latest/edge/) or by following the instructions below for each platform:

<Tabs
  groupId="platform"
  defaultValue="android"
  values={[
    { label: "Android", value: "android" },
    { label: "iOS", value: "ios" },
    { label: "Linux", value: "linux" },
    { label: "macOS", value: "macos" },
    { label: "Web", value: "web" },
    { label: "Windows", value: "windows" },
  ]}

  <TabItem value="android">
    Because of the limitations on internal testing set by the Google Play Store, develop builds on Android are only available upon request to a very limited amount of users.
