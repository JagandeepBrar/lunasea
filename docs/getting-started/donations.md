# Donations

Thanks for considering donating to LunaSea! Donations are what keep the project alive and completely free for everyone to use. There are a few options available:

## In-App Purchases

If you have downloaded LunaSea through the Play Store or App Store, you can directly donate using in-app purchases! Simply head to the Settings and tap the "Donations" tile. There are four options available \(all scaled to USD\): **$0.99, $2.99, $4.99, and $9.99**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are using TestFlight builds on iOS devices, you will need to switch to the App Store version to donate. Any in-app purchases executed on a TestFlight build do not actually get processed.
{% endhint %}

## Ko-Fi

I have setup a Ko-Fi account for LunaSea, available here: [https://ko-fi.com/jagandeepbrar](https://ko-fi.com/jagandeepbrar).

Ko-Fi allows you to make a one-time donation in $1 increments using PayPal.

## GitHub Sponsors

I also have setup a GitHub Sponsors account, which is available here: [https://github.com/sponsors/JagandeepBrar](https://github.com/sponsors/JagandeepBrar).

GitHub Sponsors allow you to setup a recurring donation in the amount of $1 to $5.
