# Sonarr

Adding your Sonarr instance to LunaSea only requires a few steps to get going!

> This documentation only covers adding Sonarr to LunaSea via local area network (LAN) connections, and does not cover exposing Sonarr externally and connecting remotely.

## Preparation

#### Find Your Local Area Network IP Address

Finding your local area network IP address of the machine running Sonarr is the first step to get setup. To find your local IP address, please look at the following guides:

- [Linux](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/07/find-ip-address-ubuntu-20-04/)
- [macOS](https://osxdaily.com/2010/11/21/find-ip-address-mac/)
- [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-your-ip-address-in-windows-f21a9bbc-c582-55cd-35e0-73431160a1b9)

If you are running a different operating system, you can use any search engine to look up "Find local IP address on \<your operating system\>" to typically find tons of guides for any platform.

> It is recommended to set your host machine's IP address to be statically assigned instead of dynamic/DHCP. This ensures that the IP address will not change through machine or network reboots.

#### Check What Port is Being Used

If using the default installation, Sonarr runs on port **8989**. In most cases, this port is not changed and does not need to be changed.

The simplest way to check is to go to Sonarr's web GUI, go to Settings -> General and note the value entered into "Port Number".

#### Ensure Sonarr is Accessible Across Your Network

To ensure that Sonarr is accessible across your local network, check the following:

- In Sonarr's web GUI, go to Settings -> General and enable advanced settings, then ensure that the "Bind Address" is set to `*`
- Check any enabled firewalls to confirm that the port running Sonarr is not being blocked
- _(Windows Only)_: Ensure that Sonarr has been run as administrator at least once

#### Check If You Are Using a URL Base

In Sonarr's web GUI, go to Settings -> General and check the value of "URL Base". If you have nothing set, you can move on. If you do have a value set, please remember the set value as it will be necessary when setting the host within LunaSea.

## Connecting in LunaSea

#### Host

The host is a combination of multiple values found above:

- The local IP address
- The port
- If being used, the URL base

Combine all the values into the following format: `<IP address>:<port>/<URL base>`

For example, if Sonarr is running on port `8989` on a machine that has the IP address `192.168.100.100` with a URL base set to `/sonarr`, the host is: `http://192.168.100.100:8989/sonarr`. If it had no URL base set, it would be `http://192.168.100.100:8989`.

#### API Key

The API key is copied from Sonarr's web GUI, by going to Settings -> General and finding the API key value.

#### Custom Headers

Custom headers allows users to attach custom request headers to each API call that is made. This is typically an advanced feature, and is not necessary in most network configurations.
