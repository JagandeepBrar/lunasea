# Overseerr Notifications

## Preparation

1. Read through the main [Notifications](/lunasea/notifications) page
2. Copy your device-based or user-based webhook URL from LunaSea

## Setup the Webhook

In Overseerr's web GUI, head to Settings -> Notifications -> LunaSea. Ensure that the agent is enabled, then follow each section below to setup the webhook:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="webhook_url"
  values={[
    { label: "Webhook URL", value: "webhook_url" },
    { label: "Profile Name", value: "profile_name" },
    { label: "Notification Types", value: "notification_types" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="webhook_url">
  Paste the full device-based or user-based URL that was copied from LunaSea.

  Overseerr currently only supports 1 LunaSea notification agent, which means you can only setup a single user-based or device-based notification.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="profile_name">
  The profile name field should be an _exact match_ to the profile that this module instance was added to within LunaSea. Capitalization and punctuation does matter.

  > This step is only required if you are not using the default LunaSea profile (`default`). LunaSea will assume the default profile when none is supplied.
  >
  > Correctly setting up this field is critically important to get full deep-linking support.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="notification_types">
  Select which events should trigger a push notification. The following triggers are supported:

  |            Trigger             | Supported? |
  | :----------------------------: | :--------: |
  |    Request Pending Approval    |   Yes ✅   |
  | Request Automatically Approved |   Yes ✅   |
  |        Request Approved        |   Yes ✅   |
  |        Request Declined        |   Yes ✅   |
  |       Request Available        |   Yes ✅   |
  |   Request Processing Failed    |   Yes ✅   |
  |         Issue Reported         |   Yes ✅   |
  |         Issue Comment          |   Yes ✅   |
  |         Issue Resolved         |   Yes ✅   |
  |         Issue Reopened         |   Yes ✅   |
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once setup, close LunaSea and run the webhook test in Overseerr. You should receive a new notification letting you know that LunaSea is ready to receive Overseerr notifications!

## Example

An example Overseerr webhook can be seen below:

- This is a user-based notification webhook, meaning it will be sent to all devices that are linked to the user ID `1234567890`
- The webhook is associated with the profile named `My Profile`
