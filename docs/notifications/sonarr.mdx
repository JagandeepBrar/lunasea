# Sonarr Notifications

## Preparation

1. Read through the main [Notifications](/lunasea/notifications) page
2. Copy your device-based or user-based webhook URL from LunaSea

## Setup the Webhook

In Sonarr's web GUI, head to Settings -> Connect, hit the "+" button to add a new connection and select "Webhook". Please follow each section below to setup the webhook:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="name"
  values={[
    { label: "Name", value: "name" },
    { label: "Triggers", value: "triggers" },
    { label: "Tags", value: "tags" },
    { label: "URL", value: "url" },
    { label: "Method", value: "method" },
    { label: "Username", value: "username" },
    { label: "Password", value: "password" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="name">
  Select any name, for example "LunaSea".
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="triggers">
  Select which events should trigger a push notification. The following triggers are supported:

  |              Trigger               | Supported? |
  | :--------------------------------: | :--------: |
  |              On Grab               |   Yes ✅   |
  |             On Import              |   Yes ✅   |
  |             On Upgrade             |   Yes ✅   |
  |             On Rename              |   Yes ✅   |
  |          On Series Delete          |   No ❌    |
  |       On Episode File Delete       |   No ❌    |
  | On Episode File Delete For Upgrade |   No ❌    |
  |          On Health Issue           |   Yes ✅   |
  |      Include Health Warnings       |   Yes ✅   |
  |       On Application Update        |   No ❌    |
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tags">
  You can _optionally_ select a tag that must be attached to a series for the webhook to get triggered.

  This can be useful when working with a large media collection to only receive notifications for content you are actively monitoring.

  If you want to receive notifications for all series, leave the tags area empty.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="url">
  Paste the full device-based or user-based URL that was copied from LunaSea.

  Each webhook can support a single user-based or device-based webhook URL. Attaching multiple device-based or user-based webhooks to a single Sonarr instance requires setting up multiple webhooks.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="method">
  Keep the method on `POST`. Changing the method to `PUT` will cause the webhooks to fail.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="username">
  The username field should be an _exact match_ to the profile that this module instance was added to within LunaSea. Capitalization and punctuation does matter.

  > This step is only required if you are not using the default LunaSea profile (`default`). LunaSea will assume the default profile when none is supplied.
  >
  > Correctly setting up this field is critically important to get full deep-linking support.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="password">
  Leave the password field empty. Setting this field will currently have no effect.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once setup, close LunaSea and run the webhook test in Sonarr. You should receive a new notification letting you know that LunaSea is ready to receive Sonarr notifications!

## Example

An example Sonarr webhook can be seen below:

- No tags are set for this webhook, meaning all series will trigger a notification
- This is a user-based notification webhook, meaning it will be sent to all devices that are linked to the user ID `1234567890`
- The webhook is associated with the profile named `My Profile`
