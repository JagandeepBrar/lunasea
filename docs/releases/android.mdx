# Android Releases

> If you want a stable experience, stick with stable releases. Want to test new builds of LunaSea? Read about the [build channels](/getting-started/build-channels) to make the right choice!

LunaSea is available on Android 7.0+.

Note that Google Play Services are not required for core functionality, however LunaSea account features and push notifications are not supported at this time.

## Google Play Store

_Channel(s): `Stable`, `Candidate`, `Beta`, `Edge`_

The easiest way for most users with Android devices would be to download releases of LunaSea directly from the [Google Play Store](https://www.lunasea.app/playstore)!
