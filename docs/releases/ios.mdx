# iOS Releases

> If you want a stable experience, stick with stable releases. Want to test new builds of LunaSea? Read about the [build channels](/getting-started/build-channels) to make the right choice!

LunaSea is available on iOS 11.0+.

Note that installation of iOS app package (`.ipa`) files is a relatively advanced task and instructions are outside the scope of LunaSea's documentation and no support will be provided.

## App Store

_Channel(s): `Stable`_

The easiest way for most users with iOS devices who want stable releases would be to download releases of LunaSea directly from the [App Store](https://www.lunasea.app/appstore)!

## TestFlight

_Channel(s): `Stable`, `Candidate`, `Beta`, `Edge`_

The easiest way for most users with iOS devices to use test channels is using the [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/app/testflight/id899247664) platform!
